Natural Language PostgreSQL
This project is a Next.js application that allows users to query a PostgreSQL database using natural language and visualize the results. It's powered by the AI SDK by Vercel and uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to translate natural language queries into SQL.
Features
Natural Language to SQL: Users can input queries in plain English, which are then converted to SQL using AI.
Data Visualization: Results are displayed in both table and chart formats, with the chart type automatically selected based on the data.
Query Explanation: Users can view the full SQL query and get an AI-generated explanation of each part of the query.
Technology Stack
Next.js for the frontend and API routes
AI SDK by Vercel for AI integration
OpenAI's GPT-4o for natural language processing
PostgreSQL for data storage
Vercel Postgres for database hosting
Framer Motion for animations
ShadowUI for UI components
Tailwind CSS for styling
Recharts for data visualization
How It Works
The user enters a natural language query about unicorn companies.
The application uses GPT-4 to generate an appropriate SQL query.
The SQL query is executed against the PostgreS

QL database.
Results are displayed in a table format.
An AI-generated chart configuration is created based on the data.
The results are visualized using the generated chart configuration.
Users can toggle between table and chart views.
Users can request an explanation of the SQL query, which is also generated by AI.
Data 
The database contains information about unicorn companies, including:

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

Install dependencies:

pnpm install
Copy the example environment file:

cp .env.example .env
Add your OpenAI API key and PostgreSQL connection string to the .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
POSTGRES_URL="..."
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="..."
POSTGRES_URL_NO_SSL="..."
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="..."
POSTGRES_USER="..."
POSTGRES_HOST="..."
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="..."
POSTGRES_DATABASE="..."
Download the dataset:

Go to https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies
Download the unicorn companies dataset
Save the file as unicorns.csv in the root of your project
Seed the database:

pnpm run seed
Start the development server:

pnpm run dev
our project should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
The project is set up for easy deployment on Vercel. Use the "Deploy with Vercel" button in the repository to create your own instance of the application.
